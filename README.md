Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard

Overview
This project presents a Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard built using Power BI, designed to provide insightful visualizations and comprehensive analysis of sales data for a coffee shop. The dashboard serves as a powerful tool for monitoring and understanding various sales metrics, trends, and performance indicators over a specified period.

Key Features
Data Cleaning & Preparation: The raw sales data was first cleaned and manipulated using MySQL to ensure accuracy and consistency before being imported into Power BI for visualization.

Dynamic Filtering: Users can filter data by month and day using the filter panel, allowing for the analysis of sales trends within specific timeframes. 
A calendar view enables quick selection of specific dates, providing granular control over the data displayed.

Comprehensive Sales Insights: Total Sales, Orders, and Quantity: High-level metrics displayed prominently at the top of the dashboard provide a snapshot of the coffee shop's performance.

Sales Trend Over the Period: A bar chart showcases daily sales trends, with the average sales value highlighted to provide context.

Sales by Weekday/Weekend: A donut chart illustrates the distribution of sales between weekdays and weekends, helping to identify peak periods.

Sales Analysis by Product: Sales by Product Category: Breakdown of sales into various categories such as coffee, tea, snacks, and other items, allowing for a detailed understanding of product performance.
Sales by Product Type: Further granularity is provided by categorizing sales into specific product types, such as espresso, brewed coffee, and specialty drinks.

Geographical and Time-Based Insights: Sales by Store Location: Analyze performance across different store locations, identifying top-performing areas and potential growth opportunities.
Sales by Hour and Day: A heatmap visualization reveals the busiest hours and days for the coffee shop, aiding in staffing and inventory decisions.

Custom Tooltips: Two custom tooltips have been created to provide additional context and insights when hovering over specific data points, enriching the user's analytical experience.


Tools & Technologies :
MySQL: Used for data cleaning and preparation, ensuring the dataset was ready for analysis.
Power BI: Leveraged for creating advanced visualizations, DAX measures, and custom tooltips.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Employed to build dynamic calculations and aggregations that drive the insights presented in the dashboard.


Conclusion
This project showcases my ability to clean and prepare data using SQL, as well as to create complex, dynamic dashboards in Power BI. The Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard is a robust tool for any coffee shop looking to gain actionable insights into their sales data.
